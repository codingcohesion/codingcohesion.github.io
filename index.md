## Welcome! 

### You have reached the GitHub page for Derek Fitzgerald.

This site is for documenting my learnings and projects. I have been doing software development for the past twenty five (plus) years, starting in C++ and Java. My primary focus has during the last twenty years has been on .Net (since .Net 1.0) apps (Windows and Web) and SQL Server backend. I have recently been working with React and Hana and have worked on same Angular JS apps.  
  
This site is a work in progress and I expect it to start coming together as I start building our sample projects for the subjects I learn or plan to document. If you happen to stumble upon my pages, please reach out and let me know your intrests. I **love** to learn new things as well as help others.
